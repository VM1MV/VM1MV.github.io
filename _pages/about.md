Yuqi Zhao, a Ph.D. candidate from the Software Engineering program at Wuhan University's School of Computer Science, enrolled in 2018 under the supervision of Professor Li Bing. Expected to graduate in December 2023, Zhao's research focuses on software engineering, services computing, and edge computing. Their relevant work has been published in journals and conferences within the fields of service computing and artificial intelligence, such as KBS, ICWS, ICSOC, TNSM, and JCST. Zhao has been honored with the Distinguished Paper Award at ICSOC2023 and the Best Student Paper Award at ICWS2021. In 2022, Zhao was recognized as one of the 3551 talents in Optics Valley, and in 2023, he achieved the Silver Award in the 9th China International ``Internet Plus" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for College Students.

My research interest include software engineering, services computing, and edge computing. I have published more than 10 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qfstZDsAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>100+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qfstZDsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
