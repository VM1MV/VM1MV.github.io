[SAMPLE: Spatiotemporal-Aware Microservice Pre-deployment with LLMs for Edge Computing]

[**Project**](https://github.com/ssea-lab/SAMPLE) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='qfstZDsAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- To tackle the impact of spatiotemporal user location dynamics on microservice pre-deployment in edge computing, and the inefficiency of manual adjustments, this paper proposes SAMPLE, a spatiotemporal-aware LLM-based method. It uses LLMs to predict future user locations, identify target microservices for edge servers under coverage constraints, and leverages heuristics to guide LLMs in generating a scoring algorithm. Modeling pre-deployment as sequential decision-making, edge servers prioritize top-scoring microservices per round, enabling autonomous adaptation to user movements and dynamic optimization for improved service quality, efficiency, and responsiveness..
