**Yuqi Zhao** is a lecturer and postdoctoral researcher at the School of Computer Science, Central China Normal University. Zhao received a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from Wuhan University in December 2023, under the supervision of Professor Li Bing. Zhao's research interests include software engineering, services computing, and edge computing. Relevant work has been published in high-quality journals and conferences, such as **KBS**, **ICWS**, **ICSOC**, **TNSM**, and **JCST**.

Currently, Zhao is leading two postdoctoral research projects funded by the **China Postdoctoral Science Foundation** and the **National Postdoctoral Program**, focusing on advancing software and edge computing technologies. Zhao has been recognized with several honors, including the **Distinguished Paper Award** at **ICSOC 2023** and the **Best Student Paper Award** at **ICWS 2021**. In addition, Zhao's contributions were acknowledged as one of the **3551 talents in Optics Valley** in 2022. More recently, Zhao guided students to achieve a **Silver Award** at the **Challenge Cup National Competition** and won the **Silver Award** in the **9th China International "Internet Plus" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for College Students**.
